# 📌 About [YRCodes](https://yrcodes.ca)
At YRCodes, our goal is delivering free, intuitive, and easy-to-follow lessons on the basics of computer science that can help students across Ontario learn the fundamentals of programming. We are a resource for students seeking to further their learning in class, as well as a resource for students who do not have access to computer science courses.

Understanding is always the number one priority, which is why we include quizzes at the end of each lesson. We strive to help students improve their critical thinking skills and ensure they can apply the concept themselves. We hope this resource becomes a useful study tool for those everywhere!

## 👨‍🏫 Courses
